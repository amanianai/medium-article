          <h1>From Bootstrapping to Building a Brand that Scales and Something</h1>
          <h3>All the lessons we learnt along the way.</h3>
            <p>
              Back in 2013, S√©bastien, my brother Romain and I decided to launch a coding school to
               teach creative and entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their own tech
               products through an intensive 9-week bootcamp. At that time, none of us had real
               design or branding skills. My brother was a lawyer. S√©bastien and I were both
               engineers (French engineers, aka the worst kind in terms of design background üò¨).
             </p>
             <p>
              We only knew one thing: we wanted to build a program to teach people the technical
              skills and tools to bring their ideas to life. This program would go far beyond
              ‚Äúbecoming a full-stack developer‚Äù or ‚Äúlearning UX/UI Design, HTML, CSS, ruby and
              Javascript‚Äù. For us, these skills were also a prerequisite for anyone who wanted to
              develop tech projects autonomously in their current job, start a freelancing career
              or launch their own startup. And we felt that traditional degrees‚Äô courses were failing
              to provide students with these new tech skills. As we say in French‚Ä¶
